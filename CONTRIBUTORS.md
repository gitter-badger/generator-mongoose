generator-restgoose contributors
===============================

The generator-restgoose project is primarily a fork of [generator-mongoose](https://github.com/afj176/generator-mongoose). Throughout many projects, the fork has evolved to somewhat a distinct repo of its own. The underlying architecture and segration of code has been altered and made to comply with rapid development and making sense.
